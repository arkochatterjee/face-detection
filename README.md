Face Detection using OpenCV and Python

Number of faces can be detected in any picture or from your webcam using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to distinguish the faces in the image.

Run face-detect.py to detect number of faces in an image.
(test1 = cv2.imread('This is the location of the image in your system'))

Run webcam.py to detect the number of faces from your webcam.

OpenCV and Python are required to run these files.
Assuming you already have Python.

Just install OpenCV using pip install opencv-python!
